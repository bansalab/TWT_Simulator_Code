# TWT_Simulator_Code
A MATLAB based framework for design of Staggered Double Vane Slow Wave Structures for Traveling Wave Tubes.

Author: Aakash Bansal (in.aakash.bansal@ieee.org)
Supervised by: Dr. Vishnu Srivastava (Emeritus Scientist, CSIR-CEERI, Pilani)

Instructions to operate:

* The folder contains different test cases and versions with improvements.
* Use the latest code and run using MATLAB.

Important Details:

* Feed the basic details as per requirements in section one of the code.
* Keep NS=8 and ND=12 for a faster and reliable solution.
* NS and ND can be increased for a more accurate prediction, but this will increase the simulation time period.
* The code doesn't take magnetic fields into consideration.
* It is fully dependent on different Electric Fields present within the tube.
